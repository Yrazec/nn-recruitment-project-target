# A public recruitment target project
A project that will serve as a recruitment application. It's target application created with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) services.

# Dependencies

# Importants
- The project is not an independent application that can be run from the CLI. The project works closely with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) service. A link to work with LIVE version of this project can be found here: [nn-recruitment-project-target ∙ main ∙ streamlit_app.py](https://yrazec-nn-recruitment-project-target-streamlit-app-bbpghg.streamlit.app/).
